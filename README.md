## Constructing the model architecture
To solve this problem i have implemented UNet with total trainable params of 31, 043, 521.
The model code can be found [here](https://github.com/futartup/S15AB/blob/master/library/model/u_net.py)
![alt-text-1](https://github.com/futartup/S15AB/blob/master/raw_images/unet.png)

The saved models are stored in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1A8jBzOUM_WPFKIa-gjjYs3H9tTffAGyL).
The code for storing the saved model can be found [here](https://github.com/futartup/S15AB/blob/master/train.py).

## Representation of task
The goal is to segment the cars(which is the case in my case) in an image and predict the depth in an image. Simply, my goal is to take either a RGB color image (height×width×3) or a grayscale image (height×width×1) and output a segmentation map where each pixel contains a class label represented as an integer (height×width×1). 

There are four kinds of inputs which are classified into bg, fg_bg, mask and depth. The explanation for these categories of images can be found below. The mask and depth are the ground truths for our images. The mask has only one class which is a vehicle class as of now only. The depth dataset has been created using this [repo](https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/blob/master/DenseDepth.ipynb)

The fg_bg and bg images are feed into the model. The masks and depth are used as targets in our criterion. The loss is added up and then autograd will backprop in this total loss. But the gradients will be for these individual losses.

## Loss functions
I have used CrossEntropyLoss for mask prediction and MSELoss for depth estimation. 
There is only one class which is vehicle in out dataset now. I have plans to add some more classes in the dataset. 

For the depth prediction MSELoss function is used since i want to find the loss for the each pixels.

These loss functions can be defined in [here](https://github.com/futartup/S15AB/blob/master/config.py)

## Creation of dataset
### Choosing of background images
For choosing background images i have choosen the natural scenery images. The scenery images are choosen in such a way that there are very less subjects in the image. I will overlay foreground images on top of these scene images on randon positions. 
The duplicate images produces bias so these images are reduced using this [code](https://github.com/futartup/S15A/blob/master/detect_and_remove_duplicate_images.py).

The number of these backgroud images are 100 of size 224 * 224.
The scene images are as follows-

![alt-text-2](https://github.com/futartup/S15A/blob/master/raw_images/background_images_224/images150.png)

### Choosing of foreground images
For foreground images the size is 100 * 100. All the images are of cars. The images are made transparent using GIMP software. Some of the transparent png images of car is downloaded from various sources in internet. The number of these foreground images are 100 of size 100 * 100. The images are as follows-

![alt-text-1](https://github.com/futartup/S15A/blob/master/raw_images/foreground_images_100/image24.png) 
![alt-text-2](https://github.com/futartup/S15A/blob/master/raw_images/foreground_images_100/images10.png ) 
![alt-text-1](https://github.com/futartup/S15A/blob/master/raw_images/foreground_images_100/maruti-suzuki-car-india-car.png)

These foreground images are flipped randomly.

### Masked images of foreground images
Each foreground images are masked using GIMP software and it looks as follows-

### Overlayed images
Each foreground and flipped foreground images are randomly placed over background images 20 times and it looks as follows-

![alt-text-2](https://github.com/futartup/S15A/blob/master/raw_images/fg_bg_images/15.png)

The program which is used to overlay foreground images on background images is [here](https://github.com/futartup/S15A/blob/master/overlay_images.py). The same program is used to generate the mask images which looks as follows:

![alt-text-2](https://github.com/futartup/S15AB/blob/master/raw_images/masked_black_images/399536.jpg)

### Depth images
Each fg_bg images are passed through [this model](https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/blob/master/DenseDepth.ipynb) and created 400K depth images which looks as follows:

![alt-text-1](https://github.com/futartup/S15A/blob/master/raw_images/depth_bw/0.jpg)

## About me
My name is Anup Gogoi and i am an computer vision and AI enthusiast. My dream is to develop products which actually augment the intelligence of mankind in specially medical domain. Human brain can do very complex things, But still it will take some time to figure out the best medicine for Coronavirus pandemic, whereas a combined effort of human and artificial intelligence can do that in very less time.

My github repo is public and collaborators, suggestions are always welcomed.
